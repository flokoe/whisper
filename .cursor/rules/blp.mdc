This project uses the modern, declarative Blueprint DSL to describe the UI.

If you see references to old XML UI files (`.ui` extension) it probably refers to compiled resources in the Flatpak.
Try to look for coresponding files with an `.blp` extension. Example:

`windows.ui` -> `window.blp`

Also, **never** create `.ui` files. **Always** use the new Blueprint syntax and `.blp` files.
