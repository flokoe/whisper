**Always** use the `uv` cli to perform project and dependency management for Python projects.

For example management of Python versions, virtual environments or adding/removing of dependencies.

If I ask yout to install/add dependencies, **always** use `uv add`.

If you need help using uv or I ask you about it check my custom documention @uv.
